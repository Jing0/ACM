 *
 *    Description:  
 *    Problem Description
 *    Write a program to determine the summation of several sets of integers.
 *    Input
 *    The input file will consist of up to 250 sets of integers, where each set contains at most 100 integers and the integer values will be between â€“16000 and + 16000. Each set of numbers is started with the number of integers in the set, n. The next n input lines will each contain one integer of the set. You should stop processing when the size of the set, n, is<= 0.
 *    Output
 *    A single line of output should be generated for each set of integers. The line should have format shown below.
 *    Sample Input
 *    4
 *    -1
 *    3
 *    1
 *    1
 *    2
 *    19
 *    17
 *    5
 *    -645
 *    952
 *    -1488
 *    -5456
 *    -9342
 *    -1
 *    Sample Output
 *    Sum of #1 is 4
 *    Sum of #2 is 36
 *    Sum of #3 is -15979
