 *    He remembers the words according to Ebbinghaus memory curve method.
 *    He separates the words into many lists. Every day he picks up a new list, and in the next $1^{st}, 2^{nd}, 4^{th}, 7^{th}, 15^{th}$ day, he reviews this list.
 *    So every day he has many lists to review. However he is so busy, he does not know which list should be reviewed in a certain day. Now he invites you to write a program to tell him which list should to be reviewed in a certain day.

 *    Input
 *    Multi test cases (about 100), every case contains an integer n in a single line.
